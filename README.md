# 🌾 Crop Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to **analyze and preprocess crop price data** to understand patterns and prepare the dataset for building machine learning models.  
It is designed as a beginner-friendly data science project to demonstrate skills in **data preprocessing, cleaning, and exploratory analysis**.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- `crop_price_dataset.csv` → Raw dataset containing crop prices.  
- `data_preprocess.ipynb` → Jupyter/Colab notebook with data preprocessing steps.  
- `README.md` → Project documentation.  

## 🚀 Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading** – Read dataset into Pandas DataFrame.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, removing duplicates, fixing inconsistencies.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Basic descriptive statistics and visualization.  
4. **Feature Preparation** – Preparing dataset for machine learning models (scaling, encoding if required).  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Google Colab  

## 📊 Future Work
- Apply **Machine Learning models** (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).  
- Predict **future crop prices** based on historical data.  
- Build a **web app** to make predictions user-friendly.  

## 🤝 How to Use
